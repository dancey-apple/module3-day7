Testing Types
- Unit Testing
    * Most basic and arguably most important. Thought of the least. 
    * Tests each function block to make sure it functions/errors as expectd.
    * Meant to test single functions at a time. (Sometimes multiple test per block)
    * Allow you to make changes to the codebase without scaring devs :D
- Integration Testing
    * Test the interaction between different parts of the code base.
- E2E Testing
 * End to End test
 * QA sees the most "sexyest" or the most fun to watch.
 * Test an entire workflow
 * Traditionally done by manual testers, being automated anymore. 
 * Problem: Sophistocated system have infinate outcomes.
    * Test major paths
